# CNN from Scratch Using NumPy

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using NumPy. The CNN is built to perform image classification tasks by implementing key components such as convolution layers, pooling layers, and activation functions. 
It demonstrates how CNNs can be constructed and trained without relying on external deep learning libraries, providing a foundational understanding of their inner workings.## Article Reference

This project was built with the guidance of the article [Building a Convolutional Neural Network in NumPy from Scratch](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/04/building-convolutional-neural-network-numpy-scratch.html). 
The article offers a detailed explanation of CNN theory and step-by-step code implementation using NumPy.

## Class Project

This project was developed as part of the Neural Network class under the instruction of [Professor Vignesh Narayanan](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/engineering_and_computing/faculty-staff/narayanan_vignesh.php) at the University of South Carolina.
